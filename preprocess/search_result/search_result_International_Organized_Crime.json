				"text": "BFN \n [Report by \"k.h.\": \"Use Intelligence Services\"] \n  [Text] Berlin -- Eckart Werthebach, president of the \nFederal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], has \ncome out in favor of using the intelligence services also to \ncombat organized crime. At an international expert conference \nof the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation about the responsibilities of \npolice and intelligence services in the democratic rule-of-law \nstate, Werthebach said in the Berlin Reichstag that this \nexpansion of authority must be decided by politics. It would \npreserve the separation of powers and the independence of police \nand intelligence services. As the representative of the police, \nLeopold Schuster, head of the Counternarcotic Department in the \nFederal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA], objected to \nWerthebach's statements. Expanding the tasks of the \nintelligence services is not absolutely necessary, he said. In \naddition, there are constitutional obstacles to it. \n  Werthebach justified his proposal by saying that the BfV has \nexperience in counterespionage and in keeping an eye on both \nnational and international underground terrorist movements. His \noffice is better equipped in terms of \"means of surveillance\" \nthan the police. The precondition for taking over the task of \ncombating crime is an increase in personnel as well as an \namendment to the Federal Constitutional Protection Law. \nWerthebach sees potential work for the BfV in observing \norganized crime structures that might exert influence over the \nmedia. It is urgently necessary to harmonize the methods and \nlegal bases of intelligence services all over Europe. In \naddition, in Germany there is no central interlocutor for the \nEuropean intelligence services. Werthebach said that currently \nthe most dangerous form of organized crime is the illegal \ntransport of radioactive substances from the CIS into West \nEurope. \n  Schuster explained his rejection of BfV cooperation by \nsaying \nthat preinvestigations are usual in the police and not a \nprivilege of the intelligence services. Rather, in view of \nabout 7 million crimes in 1993, the BKA is forced to cope with \n\"considerable problems regarding resources.\" In order to \n\"comprehensively\" combat organized crime, the BKA demands the \nauthority of a central body. According to Schuster, last year \nthere were 776 investigations of 10,000 individuals suspected of \ninvolvement in organized crime. \n"

Further tens of thousands, \nmainly from African countries, are transported by gangs to other \ncountries via Austria. Loeschnak stated: \"This is a thriving \nbusiness.\" Up to $10,000 is being charged per person. \n  Another type of crime is also spreading in Austria, namely \nthe extortion of money through blackmail. Loeschnak believes \nthat \"at least every third, but maybe even every second\" citizen \nfrom Turkey and the former Yugoslavia is being blackmailed by \norganized gangs to pay protection money. \n  Austrian companies that are carrying out orders abroad are \nalso faced with blackmail. Loeschnak claimed that they are \n\"paying without hesitation\" so as not to endanger their workers \nabroad. The climax of these criminal machinations has not yet \nbeen reached, and the international threat has reached a \n\"considerable extent.\" \n  Loeschnak spoke of \"very sophisticated\" econmic crime where \n\"big chiefs\" of international concerns illegally \"embezzle \nhundreds of millions of schillings, German marks, or dollars.\" \n  Loeschnak mentioned several measures to be taken by the \nexecutive bodies to get the situation under control. The \nestablishment of special units are an initial step. In the \nsphere of drugs, specialist have been active for years. This \nmust be extended to economic crimes, the smuggling of refugees \nand of cars. \n  To achieve success in the fight against organized crime, \n\"suitable tools\" are needed. Loeschnak mentioned the so-called \nbugging campaign, \"no matter whether big, medium-sized, or \nsmall,\" and the state's regulation of evidence. \"We should not \ndevelop any philosophies or principles in this respect. This is \nnot important. What we need are suitable instruments.\" \n  In this respect, the interior minister clearly supported \nmembership in the European Union, because international \ncooperation against cross-border crime must be intensified. \n"

				"text": "Language:  German \nArticle Type:BFN \n [Markus Lesch report: \"In The Throes of Crime\"] \n  [Text] International crime is gaining increasing control \nover Germany's eastern neighbors. Organized crime is \nestablishing itself in Poland and the Czech Republic along its \npath to Western markets, with Germany as the objective. The \neastern laender can feel this already. \n  \"In those countries, organized crime wants to earn its fare \nto come to Germany, so to speak, and is establishing permanent \ninfrastructures there,\" said Saxony's Interior Minister Heinz \nEggert at an international conference on internal security in \nDresden. \n  \"Western European crime is quickly spreading to the East,\" \nwarned the president of the Czech Criminal Police Colonel Jan \nVaculik. The most significant organized crime rings in the \nCzech Republic are groups of people from the Russophone area. \n\"These groups are virtually impossible to overcome. They \nenforce silence with brutal methods, similar to those used by \nthe Mafia in relation to the Omerta,\" Vaculik explained. \n  Contacts between this \"Russo-Mafia\" and Italian groups have \nbeen documented. Crime bosses from Naples and Moscow have \nalready met in Prague in order to organize the smuggling of \ncocaine. The strongest Italian group is the notorious Camorra \nfrom Naples. Vaculik: \"We have information that the Camorra \nwants to expand even further, to Russia and Estonia.\" \n  The third organized crime group consists of the Chinese \n\"Flying Dragons and `K-14' from New York, who extort protection \nmoney and deal in transfers of human cargo from the Far East to \nGermany and Western Europe. \n  Warnings signals are also coming from Poland, especially \nregarding drugs. \"Poland has become a laboratory for synthetic \ndrugs,\" says Janusz Wolny of the Polish Interior Ministry. \"In \naddition, there are increasing quantities of cocaine from South \nAmerica, heroin from the Near, Middle, and Far East, and \nmarijuana from Africa.\" The quantity of drugs seized in 1993 \nwas double the 1992 figure. \n  The brutality of the criminal elements is growing at an \nalarming rate. In 1993, in fights alone, there were 185 heavy \noffenses, including 56 homicides, 31 kidnappings, and 38 attacks \nwith firearms or grenades. \n  Even in Dresden, a hand grenade blew up in front of a police \nprecinct. \"The violence is going to get even bigger because of \nthe involvement of criminal groups from CIS and the Czech \nRepublic on the prostitution scene,\" warns Peter Raisch, \npresident of the Saxon Criminal Office. \n  The Mafia lawyer Teresa Principato from Palermo confirmed \nthe \ngrowing interest of Italian crime groups in East Europe and the \nGerman market. \"Eastern Germany is a favorite place for money \nlaundering,\" she said. \"The police forces of the different \nlaender appreciate the importance of international cooperation \nto fight crime. Now is the time for politics to follow suit,\" \nsaid Italy's best-known Mafia expert. \n"
